About my character: Not much of a friendly person, I mostly prefer to be alone. Not an introvert, no social phobia, I just have no social skills. And I am not much afraid of anything, in most situations I have no emotions or reaction at all, so I could block people for the reason that *I don't need to talk that person anymore, and I don't care about him messaging back*, this actually happens sometimes.
Also, why some are people "afraid" of sparkling water? It's actually awesome!
