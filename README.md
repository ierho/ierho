# IERHON
## Hi there 👋
### I am
- Python3 developer
- Linux user
- A bit familiar with other languages like C++, C# in unity, BASH and HTML&CSS ***(HyperText Markup Language, it's said in the name, is there "programming language" anywhere in that text?)***
- Learning django
- Familiar with Keras and numpy
- `discord.py` bot developer *(I won't make bots for other people or myself, I stopped using discord)*
- I know 🇷🇺Russian and 🇺🇸English

Some people call me shortly: 
- Ier (Russian - Иер)
- honya (Russian - хоня) (based on ier**honya**. Russian - основано на иер**хоня**)

`(last)` **Which is a nickname that wasn't made by me and I don't like it**, even though I don't care much if I'm called so. At first I couldn't even figure out who is that referring to.

About my character: Not much of a friendly person, I mostly prefer to be alone. Not an introvert, no social phobia, I just have no social skills. And I am not much afraid of anything, in most situations I have no emotions or reaction at all, so I could block people for the reason that *I don't need to talk that person anymore, and I don't care about him messaging back*, this actually happens sometimes. Also I'd rather be rude than lie (I still don't understand why it's "rude" if I say the truth in some cases).
